          <p class="lead">The good hygiene and good care of a dog depends mainly on a good prevention of the set of specific problems that can reach the animal. Knowing them and preventing them, will make them not come. And if they do, we can catch them on time and minimize them.</p>
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Bathroom.<span class="text-muted"> DOG.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Most dogs enjoy water and bathe well. The bathrooms help in the hotter periods and are also beneficial for the re-education of animals that have recently undergone a bone or joint intervention. But lots of attention with the baths in the sea. They are totally discouraged for animals that suffer skin problems. When your dog has bathed in the sea, it is preferable to rinse it with fresh water without using shampoo, in order to avoid any irritation by sea salt.</p>
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Vaccines.<span class="text-muted"> DOG.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Vaccination is the best possible prevention against common diseases that the dog may suffer. A dog must be vaccinated every year, until he is adult: when the dog reaches 5 years, it is essential to consult a veterinarian regularly in order to detect early and prevent diseases that accompany aging. For vaccines, your veterinarian is the one who can best help you.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">CAT CARE. <span class="text-muted">CANO VETERINARY.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Although they may seem like very independent animals, cat lovers know that the affective bonds created with cats through care and play are very intense and last forever. In this post you will find some useful tips for your cat to have a long and happy life.</p>
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">How should I feed my cat? <span class="text-muted"> CAT.</span> </h2>
          <p class="lead">You can feed your cat with feed, dry balanced foods or moist food. There are many flavors, presentations and brands. Choose the appropriate food for your age (puppy, adult or senior) and its physiological state (breeding, gestation, lactation, castrated, etc.). You should leave food all day in a place that is easily accessible for him and where there are no insects or rodents. You need to have fresh, clean water in another bowl, though cats love to drink from moving streams, like tiny droplets falling from a poorly closed faucet. It is not advisable to feed them with homemade diets, since it is more complicated to guarantee a correct nutritional balance.</p>
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">What are hairballs? <span class="text-muted"> CAT.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">You do not need to bathe your cat, since cats are very clean animals that groom themselves continuously throughout the day. However, the more you brush it the better it will be for your skin and your hair. You will have a stronger, thicker, brighter, healthier coat with no hairballs. Cats living on the street subjected to seasonal temperature changes and variations of light lose less hair compared to those who live at home at a constant temperature and with artificial light. This loss of hair and the washing or licking of cats often causes these accumulations of hair or tricobezoars. They usually are expelled normally, but if this does not happen, their presence in the gastrointestinal tract can cause alterations like vomiting, diarrhea, obstructions and lack of appetite among other symptoms.</p>
